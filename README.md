This website is a 2 page website with 4 sections on the main page.

The second page is the page you come till after you sign up with a thank you message and navbar that can only redirect you to the main page.

## Typography and color scheme

Text font from google fonts link: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton#standard-styles

for the color scheme i wanted to have a red and black theme on the website but i don't think it looks that good for now so alot will probably change when it comes to that.
