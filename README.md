## Features

This website is a 2 page website with 4 sections on the main page.

### The 4 sections

#### The first section (header and marketing)

This what the user will se first when the user comes to the website.

The navbar is on the top of the website.

The logo is right under the navbar.

Under the logo there is a image you can click on that will take you to DEXTools to check the live price of our token.

And under the DEXTools image there's some advertisement.

#### Navigation

The navbar helps the user to navigatet easily through 3 of the 4 sections on the website.

The navbar is fixed so it moves up and down with the user.

You can't press on the navbar to get to the first section of the website.

#### The second section (Plans)

Pretty self explanatory. On this section there's information on what features to expect and iformation about the token tokenomics.

## Typography and color scheme

Text font from google fonts link: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton#standard-styles

for the color scheme i wanted to have a red and black theme on the website but i don't think it looks that good for now so alot will probably change when it comes to that.

## Testing

I tested that this website works in: Google chrome, Microsoft edge and google chrome on my phone.

I tested this websites responsiveness using devtools device toolbar.

Everything looks good except for one thing that i will show in the images below.

When i check the responsiveness the website looks like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95103308/144765166-e91c7a37-fc15-472e-a536-d997397c6753.png)

And after i refresh the page it looks normal like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95103308/144765260-3cb93c1b-d5bf-439b-b5ed-7644ef600185.png)

I couldnt figure out how to fix this I tried using media queries but I couldn't get It to work.

I tested everything so it's readable and easy to understand. For the most part I think this is true but I think the background color and text could be better.

I think it looks a bit bad Because the background color is red.

Lighthouse explains it in the best way: "Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio."

##  Deployment

I deployed the website with github-pages.

I had to change the main page file name to index.html so it loads up correctly.

## Bugs

Only bug I have is the one with the responsiveness that i explained in the "Testing" section of the readme.

## Validator testing and lighthouse
